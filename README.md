# Electron App based on UDP and TCP socket

This is my socket programming homework.



## How to start

> Either the UDP-based app or TCP-based app work exactly the same way.

First, start the server.

```bash
cd {YOUR DIRECTORY}/{TCP or UDP}/server
node server.js

```

Second, start the react-app by `npm`

```bash
cd {YOUR DIRECTORY}/{TCP or UDP}/client
npm start

```

or by `yarn`.

```bash
cd {YOUR DIRECTORY}/{TCP or UDP}/client
yarn start


```

Third, start the electron by `npm`

```bash
cd {YOUR DIRECTORY}/{TCP or UDP}/client
npm run electron-start
```

or by `yarn`

```bash
cd {YOUR DIRECTORY}/{TCP or UDP}/client
yarn run electron-start
```
